Hello, blog!

It has been a long while since the last time I sat down and let feelings flow from mind to paper.

2016 has been generally gorgeous so far, especially I moved from Singapore to Seattle in October and have not regretted the decision yet :-)

I visited Qinghai and Tibet in September, the journey includes a 2200KM road trip, 48 hours travel by train and 3 flghts
across China, it was so fun and inspiring that no words can really describe it. So let me try with a few photos.

In terms of study and work, I have read some good books and tried lots of new things during 2016 that I really
enjoyed and learnt a lot.

I have spent most of this year building varies data services and streaming platform in [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) and be honored to work with
some of the most brilliant engineers I have ever met, we have managed to provide core data accesses to 90% of services in
Grab with under 10 milliseconds latency averagely and stays reliable under **15000+** requests per second peak. The streaming
platform we've built now produces hundreds of gigabytes of data per day and delivers billions of events to multiple
subscribers in subsecond.

And this is just a beginning, hopefully we can keep learning, keep innovating and keep growing in 2017.
